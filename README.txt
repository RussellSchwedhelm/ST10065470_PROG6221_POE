This program is designed to enable users to create, display, scale, and delete recipes using C# programming. It offers a user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate, making it accessible to users of all levels of experience.

Two notable features of this program are the incorporation of animations for displaying messages or prompts, enhancing user engagement and providing progress updates. Another interesting aspect is the program's ability to handle both words and numbers for quantities. Users can input values like "one" or 1, and the program will react and produce the same output.

The program allows users to enter ingredients with various units of measurement, such as cups, tablespoons, teaspoons, grams, kilograms, or custom units. It ensures consistent and accurate results by automatically scaling non-custom units. For instance, it can convert grams to kilograms or tablespoons to cups.

Moreover, the program includes error-handling features to prevent crashes or unexpected behaviour when users enter invalid input. If a non-numeric value is entered where a numeric value is expected, the program displays an error message and prompts the user to provide valid input.

## Getting Started

To run this program, you will need a C# development environment, such as Visual Studio, installed on your computer. If you don't have it installed, you can download it for free from the official Microsoft website:

https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/

After installing the development environment, follow these steps:

1. Open Visual Studio and select "Open a project or solution" from the start menu. Navigate to the project directory and select the .sln file to open the project.

2. Once the project is open in Visual Studio, select "Build" from the top menu bar, and then select "Build Solution". This will compile the code and create an executable file.

3. If the build is successful, you can run the program by pressing the "Start" button in the toolbar or by pressing the F5 key on your keyboard. This will launch the program in debug mode.

4. If you encounter any errors during the build or run process, check the output window for error messages. You can open the output window by selecting "View" from the top menu bar, then selecting "Output".

It's important to note that the program runs on .NET 7 framework. If you don't have it installed on your computer, you'll need to download and install it before you can run the program. You can download the .NET 7 framework from the official Microsoft website:

https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/7.0

Once you have installed .NET 7, you should be able to build and run the program without any issues.
